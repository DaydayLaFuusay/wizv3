<div class='title_sentence'><h2><b>Stay Ahead of Threats</b></h2>
    <p>To stay ahead of continuous cyber security threats, it's crucial to have a proactive approach. Regularly updating
        your systems, using advanced threat detection tools, and implementing strong access controls can significantly
        reduce your risk. Additionally, educating yourself and your team about the latest cyber threats and how to
        identify them can also play a vital role in maintaining your cyber security.</p></div>

    <caption>Why Itï¿½s Better to Avoid Cyber Threats</caption>
    <div class='importance_to_avoid_intro'>Dealing with a cyber attack is not only costly but also time-consuming. It
        can cause significant damage to your reputation and customer trust.

        <tr>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>For instance, a ransomware attack can encrypt all your data, making it inaccessible. To remediate, you
                would need to isolate the infected systems, remove the ransomware, restore the data from backups, and
                strengthen your security measures.
            </td>
            <td>This could take weeks or even months to fully resolve.</td>
        <tr>
            <td>In another scenario, a phishing attack could lead to the theft of sensitive data. The remediation
                process would involve identifying the breached data, notifying the affected parties, and implementing
                measures to prevent future breaches.
            </td>
            <td>This could also take several weeks to complete.</td>
        <tr>
            <td>A DDoS attack can overwhelm your systems and cause service interruptions. Remediation would involve
                identifying the source of the attack, mitigating it, and restoring services.
            </td>
            <td>This could take anywhere from hours to days, depending on the severity of the attack.</td>
